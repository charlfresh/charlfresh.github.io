# Clash-like MVP

This is a minimal playable MVP inspired by Clash Royale. It focuses strictly on the in-game experience: placing cards, units moving and attacking, towers with HP, and a very simple AI opponent.

Controls:
- Click a card in the right-hand deck to select it.
- Click anywhere in the bottom half of the arena to deploy the selected card (cost is consumed).

Included cards (simple prototypes): Knight, Archer, Giant, Skeleton.

How to run:
- Open index.html in a modern browser.

What's intentionally missing:
- Networking / multiplayer
- Progression, shop, animations polish
- Sound effects

This is a starting point you can iterate on â€” add better AI, particle effects, pathing, spells and more.
