### First paragraph
I ustilised aspects from websites of some of my favorite energy drink brands, being: Red Bull, Prime, and Gorilla Mind. Some of the various aspects that I put into my own work include the flavors page, which descirbes and shows the available flavors, and also the community (volt nation on my site) page which shows some recent events in the community.

### Second paragraph
At first with wordpress I did struggle a little with figuring out how to add/remove pages, add elements, resize and place images, and how to make the text bigger. But nearing the completion of my project, I am now very comfortable with creating a basic website on wordpress. Throughout the project I thought the AI image generator was really helpful, and I also loved how easy it was to view my website on the web on both my phone and laptop so I could easily see what it looked like.
