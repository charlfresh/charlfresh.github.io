# Scientific notation

### What is scientific notation

Way to represent really small and really big numbers
EX:
$45600 = 4.56\times10^4$

in this equation the base is 4.56 and the exponent is 4

$0.0077 = 7.7\times10^(-3)$

decimal numbers are written using a negative exponent on the 10

### How to multiply and divide scientific notation statements together:
multiple the bases together and then add the exponents for multiplication, for divison divide the bases and then subtract the exponents.

$(2\times10^(12))(4\times10^7) = 8\times10^(19)$

$(6.2\times10^8)\div(3.1\times10^5) = 2\times10^3$
